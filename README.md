DESCRIPTION OF GAME: (Word Count: 140)

"The Battle For Goa" is a simple Real Time Strategy Game (RTS), based on the 1990 SNK title "Crystalis." There are a few reasons why I decided to use this title as a basis for my TSA Submission.

Firstly, it's extremely strong storytelling and character development, which rivals that of even more well known titles such as Zelda or Castlevania, allows for a solid basis of my 're-imagined' game. What this will mean for this title is strong basis of events off the original, recurring themes, and ideals. Specifically: alliances and friendship, betrayal, and deception.

Secondly, because of it's very straightforward and almost cliche action-adventure gameplay loop, re-imagining it would provide almost limitless potential for different genres. For this project I decided to create an RTS, something new to me in general, especially in terms of development.


HOW TO PLAY: (Word Count: 143)

First, in the main menu, either Sound Effects and Background Music can be toggled off, from the settings page. Then, select a level. Upon entering the game, a text box with introduction dialouge will appear. At any point there is dialouge the game is not running, so don't rush! Click the box to advance the text.

When playing, there is a Heads-Up-Display in your top-right at all times. Click it to show more or less, including the pause button. This will display key data such as how many of your units are on the board, as well as your home base's health.

Your job is to defend your base from enemies. If it is destroyed, you lose the game. On top of that, click your units to assign them targets, fight enemies, and take of the enemies' base  to win!
