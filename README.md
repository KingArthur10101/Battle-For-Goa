DESCRIPTION OF GAME: (Word Count: 200)

This is a simple Real Time Strategy Game, based on the 1990 SNK title "Crystalis."
The reason behind using this game to base my TSA Project off of is for a few reasons. Firstly, with it's strong storyline and character development, especially for the era, it would make for an extremely interesting story, when divided up into seperated levels as it will be in the final product of this .
